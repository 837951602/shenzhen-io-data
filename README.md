Test data in Shenzhen IO.

Don't promise it's 100% correct. Exact source:

### Input at each time: Run a solution tick by tick and "OCR" the input. 

* Since it's an imperfect simulation (not full feedback), it's possible that screenshots desync.

### Dial: Manually inputted

* Human make mistakes.

### Cryption: Assume the most appeared key is correct.

* Relies on assumption.
